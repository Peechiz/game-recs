Geralt remembers almost nothing of his life before that point. He is taken to Kaer Morhen, the base of the witchers, where he meets a sorceress named Triss Merigold. The castle is attacked by a gang of bandits named Salamandra, led by a criminal known as the Professor, a mage named Savolla who controls a large, praying mantis-like monster, and another mage named Azar Javed. The witchers and the sorceress manage to slay the monster and kill Savolla, but the Professor and Azar manage to escape with the mutagens that genetically alter the witchers. After curing Triss of the wounds she received while fighting Javed, Geralt and the rest of the witchers head off in different directions in order to find information on Salamandra.",
    "summary": "Being based on a novel series by Andrzej Sapkowski – a bestselling Polish author – gives the game’s universe and characters credibility, authority and exceptional cohesiveness. In this harsh fantasy world abstract, absolute and unconditional ideas such as “Good” and “Evil” written in upper case letters do not exist. Instead, however, while moral good exists , the protagonist will often only have a choice between two evils, deciding on the path which he regards as the lesser evil of the two. The game also features an innovative, time delayed decision-consequence system, prodding players to make their decisions seriously and with thought.",

    "storyline": "Triss must have sensed it, too,” Geralt thought to himself. His witcher medallion twitched on his chest. Some kind of magic nearby, or some creature from another sphere. Either one spells trouble. So why hasn’t she said anything? “We’re here! And not a moment too soon – my saddle sores were about to incite an uprising.” Dandelion always complained in his performing voice, to make sure his woes registered in the cheap seats. \n \nThis time his whining seemed especially loud, as though he were shouting to something in the darkness. Perhaps the cave’s inhabitants were his intended audience. A profitable gold mine at one point, the caverns had been a gloomy, monster-infested place for decades. Villagers who wandered too close would vanish without a trace. \n \nLately, though, the gloom had receded, and no one had disappeared for months. The village elders knew someone who knew Geralt and had offered him a fat purse if he’d gather a party to look into it. The elders claimed that the calm had disrupted the village’s status quo. Yarpen stroked his beard and muttered something under his breath. He had suspected from the start the elders weren’t telling them something. But he had agreed to come anyway. Why? And Triss – why was a court sorceress willing to abandon her post for a romp in an old mine? What was so special about this cave? As soon as they plunged into the darkness, Geralt knew he would have to wait for an answer – the hungry look of the ghouls crawling out of the void promised to keep him busy for a while.",
    "summary": "The Witcher Adventure Game takes players on a journey across the world of The Witcher as they assume the roles of four distinct characters known from the books and video games: Geralt of Rivia, monster slayer; Triss Merigold, cunning sorceress; Yarpen Zigrin, dwarven warrior; and Dandelion, roguish bard. Each character has unique skills and multiple ways of overcoming obstacles—the choice is yours: do you fight your way to victory, call on your charm, or try your hand at diplomacy? \n \nA variety of quests invite players to hunt monsters, earn gold, and interact with the characters they meet in a web of alliances and treachery—a wild ride that starts as soon as you sit down to play, thanks to clear, simple rules and intuitive mechanics. Players may assist one another from time to time, but make no mistake—there can be only one winner.",

Entangled in the political turmoil that engulfed Temeria, Geralt helped quell the rebellion of the Order of the Flaming Rose. Soon after, he saved King Foltest’s life when the monarch was attacked by a witcher-like assassin. He continues to protect the king, serving as his bodyguard as Foltest strives to bring peace to his kingdom. The Order’s last bastions have yielded to the royal army, yet one more task remains - the Baroness La Valette announced her secession from the realm, and her fortress must be taken. A month after the attempted assassination, Foltest’s armies stand at the gates of La Valette Castle, preparing for a final assault. Still at Foltest’s side, Geralt is among them, unable to begin his personal quest to discover the mysterious assassin’s origin and identity.",
